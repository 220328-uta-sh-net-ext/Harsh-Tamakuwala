- view reviews of restaurants as a user
- calculate reviewsâ€™ average rating for each restaurant 
- search restaurant (by name, rating, zip code, etc.) 

## common requirements
* good Git practices
* Have you app containerized using a Dockerfile. make sure you have your image ready and pushed on docker hub.
* Deploy your app on Azure App service (either code or docker container mode).
* try to have swagger working in your deployed app.
* [optional] Have a Console App consuming the Api using HttpClient

### functionality
* server-side validation
* exception handling
* persistent data; no prices, restaurants, history, etc. hardcoded in C#
* logging of exceptions, ADO.Net SQL commands, and other events
* (optional: asynchronous network)

### design
* project layout given here is only a suggestion. the general idea of
  separation of concerns is a requirement.
* Use ADO.Net for middleware either with connected or disconnected approach
* use an Azure SQL DB in third normal form; include a database diagram and the script to generate Db and tables.
* don't use public fields
* define and use at least one interface

#### data access
* class library
* contains ADO.Net code
* contains data access logic but no business logic
* use repository pattern for separation of concerns
* DB should be on the cloud
    * try to have DB/network access async

#### ASP.NET Core REST service
* follow standard HTTP uniform interface, except hypermedia
* good architecture
* deployed to Azure App Service
* server-side validation
* logging
* implement hypermedia, or, implement an API Description Language, e.g. using Swashbuckle / Swagger

### Tech Stack 
- C# 
- Xunit or NUnit
- SQLServer DB
